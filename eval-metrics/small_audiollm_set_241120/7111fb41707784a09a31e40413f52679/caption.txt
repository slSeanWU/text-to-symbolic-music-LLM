A festive classical piece with jazz influences, this short song evokes a sense of Christmas adventure. The Hammond organ and church organ take the lead, accompanied by the acoustic bass, celesta, and French horn. Set in F# major with a 3/4 time signature, it moves at a moderate pace, featuring a chord progression of Ebm, Ab7, C#, and F#.
