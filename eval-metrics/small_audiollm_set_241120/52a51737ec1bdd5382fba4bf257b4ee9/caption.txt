A classical piece that could be part of a film soundtrack, this song features a piano and synth voice playing together at a very slow Grave tempo. The mood is relaxing and emotional, evoking a sense of meditation. Written in the key of G minor and set in 4/4 time, it includes a chord sequence of G, Cm, and Gmaj7.
